From archlinux wiki:
```
agent KeyboardOnly
default-agent
power on
scan on
# above command reveals devices
pair *device*
```

Connecting to device later on.

```
agent KeyboardOnly
default-agent
power on
devices # shows the devices and their address
connect *address*
```

Sometimes, when you switch on the bluetooth device you get prompt at blutoothctl shell
whether you want to connect or not. In this case you don't need `connect *address*`

## Attempt at pairing amazon basics bluetooth neckband.
### Update
I realized I could press power button + volume down in the neckband and it
enters a pairing mode. When the pairing mode is active, the device turned
up in bluetoothctl prompt.

Yeah. RTFM moment for me. But I still havent' read the manual though. I can't
find it. Oh well.

### Old way
Date: 02/17/2024

It was a pain in the ass to connect this device with `bluetoothctl`. I did the
usual stuff in `bluetoothctl`:

```
power on
default-agent
scan on
```

From this point I kept staring at the prompt for notification of device
discovery. It comes, but then pairing fails for some reason. Then I do the
following:

```
sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
systemctl --user restart pipewire
```

And then `Ctrl-d` out of bluetoothctl. Repeat the afforementioned usual stuff.
Nothing.

Then by accident my phone which I connected to the charging cable nearby
connects to the device. I turn of its bluetooth. THEN the device address turns
up at the at `bluetootctl prompt`. Then I did:


```
pair *address*
```

It works. For some reason it worked now though before it didn't. Finalized with

```
connect *address*
trust *address*
```

I hope its gonna be smooth sailing from this point because the device is now
listed with `devices` command at `bluetoothctl` prompt.

## Solution to failed attempt at reconnecting to a previously paired device

## Poor sound quality

### Update on sound quality

I followed the instructions at [https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PipeWire#Low_audio_quality_on_Bluetooth](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PipeWire#Low_audio_quality_on_Bluetooth)
and did the following:

```
sudo cp -r /usr/share/pipewire/media-session.d /etc/pipewire/
```
Uncommented these in `/etc/pipewire/media-session.d/bluez-monitor.conf`:

Finally:

```
systemctl --user restart pipewire
```
### Old way (worked then)

Disconnected and reconnected.
